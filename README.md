## How I worked on this project

My goal was to build a command line node.js application, which parses the input log file.
The application finds all the log messages with the level error and prints them into the output file.

## Design and Development Approach

### Design

- The scope of the application was simple. Itâ€™s a command line app that should
  read logs from an input file (like ./app.log ), extract level error logs and store them in the errors.json file in a specific format, with the following usage:
  ` > node parser.js --input ./app.log --output ./errors.json`

- Object Oriented Design was used to define the core objects of the app:
  - **FileReader**: responsible for reading the contents of the input file (`./app.log`)
  - **ErrorExtractor**: responsible for extracting the messages with the level error
  - **FileWriter**: responsible for writing the error messages to the output file (`./errors.json`)
  - **LogParser**: responsible for orchestration. It coordinates the file reading, error extraction, and file writing operations.
  - **ConsoleLogger**: responsible for logging relevant notification messages to the command line.
- SOLID, DRY, and SLAP principles were applied to keep the code extendable and
  clean

### Test Driven Development

- Unit Test cases for each object were written before developing the classes. Jest was used as a testing tool due to its efficient mocking capability
- TypeScript and Nodejs were used to develop the app


## Usage

### Step 1: Install dependencies

- `npm install`

### Step 2: Navigate to src directory

- `cd src`

### Step 3: Run the app from command line:

- `node parser.js --input ./app.log --output ./errors.json`

  The `./app.log` is the path to the input file in this case, while `./errors.json` is the path where we want to store our output.
